# Testing Strategy for Poll App

This directory contains tests for the Poll App application. The tests are organized by component and functionality.

## Test Structure

Tests are organized in the following way:

- `unit/`: Unit tests for individual components and functions
- `integration/`: Integration tests for testing interactions between components
- `e2e/`: End-to-end tests for testing the application as a whole

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you need to install the testing dependencies first:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest-environment-jsdom
```

Then add the following to your package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch"
}
```

## Writing Tests

When writing tests, use the following format:

```typescript
// #File: components/EditPollForm.tsx
// #Docs: This component handles editing of polls

describe('EditPollForm', () => {
  it('should render the form with poll data', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

The `#File` and `#Docs` anchors are used to link the test to the file being tested and to provide documentation about the component or functionality being tested.
