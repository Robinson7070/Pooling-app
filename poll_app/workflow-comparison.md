# Comparison of Inline vs. Chat Workflows

## Run A - Inline Workflow (Ghost Completions)

In the inline workflow, code is generated directly within the editor as you type, using ghost completions. This approach has several characteristics:

### Advantages

1. **Immediate Integration**: Code is written directly in the project files, eliminating the need to copy/paste from chat.
2. **Contextual Awareness**: The AI has direct access to the current file and surrounding code context.
3. **Incremental Development**: You can accept suggestions line by line, maintaining more control over the implementation.
4. **Reduced Context Switching**: You stay in the editor, focused on the code rather than switching between chat and editor.
5. **Real-time Feedback**: You can see suggestions as you type, allowing for immediate course correction.

### Limitations

1. **Limited Explanations**: Less room for detailed explanations about the code being generated.
2. **Narrower Context**: Typically focused on the current file rather than the broader project architecture.
3. **Less Comprehensive Planning**: May not provide the big-picture planning that a chat conversation allows.

## Run B - Chat Workflow (Full Code in Chat)

In the chat workflow, code is generated within the chat interface and then copied to the project. This approach has different characteristics:

### Advantages

1. **Comprehensive Explanations**: Can include detailed explanations alongside the code.
2. **Holistic Solutions**: Can present complete solutions with multiple files and components at once.
3. **Educational Value**: Explanations and reasoning are more prominent, helping you understand the implementation.
4. **Architectural Overview**: Can discuss higher-level design decisions before implementation.
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Easier to discuss and refine the solution before implementing it.

### Limitations

1. **Manual Transfer**: Requires copying code from chat to editor, which can introduce errors.
2. **Context Switching**: Requires switching between chat and editor interfaces.
3. **Potential Disconnection**: The AI may not be aware of all the latest changes in your codebase.

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Inline Workflow When

- Making small, focused changes to existing code
- Adding simple features that don't require extensive planning
- Working on familiar patterns where you need less explanation
- Wanting to maintain tight control over implementation details

### Use Chat Workflow When

- Creating new components or features from scratch
- Implementing complex logic that benefits from explanation
- Needing architectural guidance or design patterns
- Working on unfamiliar technologies where explanations are valuable
- Implementing features that span multiple files

## Conclusion

Both workflows have their place in a developer's toolkit. The inline workflow excels at quick, focused coding tasks, while the chat workflow provides more comprehensive guidance and explanation. The best approach depends on the specific task, your familiarity with the codebase, and your personal preferences.
